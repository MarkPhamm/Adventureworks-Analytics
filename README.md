# General Overview
This analytics project is dedicated to driving revenue for AdventureWorks Cycles through a comprehensive analysis of company data. The primary focus is on leveraging analytics to gain insights and identify key trends. The project involves accessing AdventureWorks Cycles' data warehouse (DW), followed by meticulous data cleaning and transformation. The subsequent steps include an in-depth examination of the company's data to extract valuable insights that can contribute to strategic decision-making.

**Goal**: 
* **Interactive:** In addition to conveying important information, our first goal aims to create interactivity through dynamic charts and dashboards. These dynamic tools help users explore information in a personalized way, encouraging them to independently navigate through the data. Our goal is not only to equip users with information but also to provide the ability to discover trends and make informed decisions consciously in their roles within AdventureWorks Cycles.
* **Dynamic, Real-time Update:** Our second goal involves ensuring the dynamic nature of our project. As data within the AdventureWorks Cycles data warehouse evolves, our charts and dashboards will seamlessly update in real-time. This dynamic feature ensures that users constantly have access to the most current information, facilitating timely and accurate decision-making.
